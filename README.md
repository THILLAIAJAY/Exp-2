# Exp - 2 LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
## NAME : DHARSHAN R
## REG NO : 212224230060
# AIM:
To design and implement a Library Management System that efficiently manages book records, student information, issue and return details, and automates library operations using a computer program.

# SRS (Procedure):
1. Analyze the requirements of the library system such as adding, searching, issuing, and returning books.
2. Design suitable data structures or database tables to store book and student information.
3. Develop algorithms for each operation like add, search, issue, return, and display.
4. Implement the program using a suitable programming language with a menu-driven interface.\
5. Test the program with different inputs to ensure all operations work correctly and produce accurate results.
